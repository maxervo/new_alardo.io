  <h1># Hi! </h1>

  <div class="intro">

    <p>
      Hi! I'm Maxime Alardo and I love meeting people around the world.
      Whether they are travelers, part of the tech community, engineers, scientists, artists, writers or more generally anyone passionate, I'm fond of making meaningful connections
      and learning even more about any subject!
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently studying Computer Science in UC San Diego, I go to hackatons, conferences, and ride waves.

    <p>
      Iâ€™m keen on information freedom, a better education system, and innovations that could help make this world a better place.
      Let's work together and have a positive impact!
    </p>
