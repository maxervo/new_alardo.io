  <div class="intro">

    <p>
      Hi! I'm an windsurfer, traveler and engineer working on emerging/frontier fields such as GenAI (multi-agent orchestration), knowledge systems and core backend applied to intelligent spaces (Cloud for IoT, fleets of connected devices, edge computing).
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been passionate about open-ended problems, science and research, as well as knowledge systems, personal computing and education (self-learning / community based learning) since growing up in Diego Suarez, Madagascar.
      Based in San Francisco Bay Area, feel free to reach out :)
